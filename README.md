# rapid :bullettrain_side:
A lightweight HTTP server for Node written in TypeScript

---

Rapid is a very minimal HTTP server library that follows the middleware/CPS style used by Express.

It currently supports `server.use(fn)` middleware style and query parsing support.

Further work involves adding built-in router support and application nesting support.

Rapid is built with modern Node and JavaScript features in mind.

:construction: This is very under development right now, but if you try using it I'd love feedback :construction:
